# Wave Software Development Challenge

## Setup

1. Clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/NoahDragon/se-challenge-payroll.git
```
2. Run init.sh:
```
bash init.sh
```
3. Start the servers, please make sure the ports 3000 and 8080 are available:
```
bash run.sh
```
4. Open http://localhost:3000/ , the app should up and running.

## Bash scripts

`init.sh`: initialize the project.

`run.sh`: start the servers.

`clear.sh`: clear up the database.

## File structure

`app` folder is generated by create-react-app. It's the APP entry point, containing the GUI and business rules logic.

`api` folder is generated by loopback-cli. It provides the database and RESTful API access.

## Troubleshooting

- Something is already running on port 3000. Probably: wave-payroll

This cause by the background process created by `run.sh`. Using command `lsof -i:3000` to get the PID, and run `kill [PID]` to terminate the process.
